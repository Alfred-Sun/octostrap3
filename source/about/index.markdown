**Octostrap3** started because I really wanted to use Bootstrap while posting
[on my blog](https://kaworu.ch) and all Octopress themes were based on
Bootstrap 2.x.

<h2>Kudos</h2>

- [TwitterÂ Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the CSS & Javascript magic
  tricks.
- [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) for making blogging with Jekyll
  awesome.
- [whitespace](https://github.com/lucaslew/whitespace) &
  [whiterspace](https://github.com/mjhea0/whiterspace) from which I borrowed a
  lot to make up this theme.
