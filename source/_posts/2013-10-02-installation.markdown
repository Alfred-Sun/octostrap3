You can install **Octostrap** like any other Octopress theme. Here is how to do it in a few steps:

<h2>Octopress Installation</h2>

If you have not installed Octopress yet, check the
[setup page](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/). For a quick test (and this
example) you can just clone the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/imathis/octopress):

    % git clone https://github.com/imathis/octopress.git

<h2>Theme installation</h2>

Installing is straightforward, just clone the them and run `rake install`:

    % cd octopress/.themes
    % git clone https://github.com/kAworu/octostrap3.git .themes/octostrap3
    % rake "install[octostrap3]"

And that's it ! You can start blogging if the default theme suits you or read
the other posts for more awesome customizations :)
