<h2>How to do it</h2>

All you have to do is to download the theme you want and then hack
`source/_includes/custom/head.html`. As an example, you can already edit it and
uncomment the Bootstrap default theme `bootstrap-theme.min.css`. Now the only
question left is how to get a new theme !


<h2>Bootswatch</h2>

[Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) contains a handful of nice themes. They're
all compatible with Bootstrap3 so just pick your favourite and go.


<h2>Bootstrap Magic</h2>

[Bootstrap Magic](http://pikock.github.io/bootstrap-magic/index.html) let you
create your own Bootstrap theme with a very nice Web app (that seems to be
completely written in JavaScript). It seems very powerful as you will have **a
lot** of option. The good news is: you can change just a few colors and keep
all the others with default values. Wether you have a lot of time or not, this
Magic will surely do the trick !


<h2>Others theme sources</h2>

Here is a list of other theme sources:

- [wrapbootstrap](https://wrapbootstrap.com/themes?branch=3.x) has many nice
  themes. You have to pay for any of them but the prices are cheap. I don't
  know how well they would work though.
